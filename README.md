
# AKS Periscope
Quick troubleshooting for your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.

# Overview
Hopefully most of the time, your AKS cluster is running happily and healthy. However, when things do go wrong, AKS customers need a tool to help them diagnose and collect the logs necessary to troubleshoot the issue. It can be difficult to collect the appropriate node and pod logs to figure what's wrong, how to fix the problem, or even to pass on those logs to others to help. 

AKS Periscope allows AKS customers to run initial diagnostics and collect and export the logs (like into an Azure Blob storage account) to help them analyze and identify potential problems or easily share the information to support to help with the troubleshooting process with a simple az aks kollect command. These cluster issues are many times are caused by wrong configuration of their environment, such as networking or permission issues. This tool will allow AKS customers to run initial diagnostics and collect logs and custom analyses that helps them identify the underlying problems.

Raw Logs and metrics from AKS cluster are collected and basic diagnostic signals are generated by analyzing these raw data. More advanced diagnostic signals can be further generated by analyzing multiple basic diagnostic signals.

# Data Privacy and Collection
AKS Periscope runs on customer's agent pool nodes, and collect VM and container level data. It is important that the customer is aware and gives consent before the tool is deployed/information shared. Microsoft guidelines can be found in the link below:

https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/legal/support-diagnostic-information-collection/


# Compatibility
AKS Periscope currently only work on Linux based agent nodes. Please see https://github.com/PatrickLang/logslurp for Windows based agent nodes. 


# Current Feature Set
It collects the following logs and metrics:

1. Container logs (by default all containers in the `kube-system` namespace, can be config to take other namespace/containers).
2. Docker and Kubelet system service logs.
3. Network outbound connectivity, include checks for internet, API server, Tunnel, Azure Container Registry and Microsoft Container Registry.
4. Node IP tables.
5. All node level logs (by default cluster provision log and cloud init log, can be config to take other logs).
6. VM and Kubernetes cluster level DNS settings.
7. Describe Kubernetes objects (by default all pods/services/deployments in the `kube-system` namespace, can be config to take other namespace/objects).
8. Kubelet command arguments.
9. System performance (kubectl top nodes and kubectl top pods).

It also generates the following diagnostic signals:

1. Network outbound connectivity, reports the down period for a specific connection.
2. Network configuration, includes Network Plugin, DNS, and Max Pods per Node settings.


# User Guide

AKS Periscope can be deployed by using Azure Command-Line tool (CLI). The steps are:

0. If CLI extension aks-preview has been installed previously, uninstall it first.
```
az extension remove --name aks-preview
``` 

1. Install CLI extension aks-preview.
```
az extension add --name aks-preview
``` 

2. Run `az aks kollect` command to collect metrics and diagnostic information, and upload to an Azure storage account.

    1. If a storage account is already setup for the AKS cluster in Diagnostic Settings (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/diagnostic-logs-stream-log-store), simply run the command below, and it automatically uses the existing storage account.
    ```
    az aks kollect -g myresourcegroup -n mycluster
    ```

    2. Specify a storage account and SAS token.
    ```
    az aks kollect -g myresourcegroup -n mycluster --storage-account mystorageaccount --sas-token mysastoken
    ```

    3. Specify a storage account resource ID.
    ```
    az aks kollect -g myresourcegroup -n mycluster --storage-account /subscriptions/xxx/resourceGroups/xxx/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/xxx
    ```


All collected logs, metrics and node level diagnostic information is stored on host nodes under directory:
```
/var/log/aks-periscope
```
This directory is also mounted to container as:
```
/aks-periscope
```
After export, they will also be stored in Azure Blob Service under a container with its name equals to cluster API server FQDN.

Alternatively, AKS Periscope can be deployed directly with `kubectl`. See instructions in [Appendix].
